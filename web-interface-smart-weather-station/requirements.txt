# Each stage of the Project images are been attached to the zipped file, 
# including the stage my Professor suggested a changed in the project 
# Moving from Arduino Uno WiFi to Arduino Nano, changing the entire project structure, 
# because we had to change the entire code, 
# entire design from a standard breadboard to a smaller breadboard to fit the 
# system case that was built for the project, 
# but on a long run it was fun working on the project with my Team mate.
